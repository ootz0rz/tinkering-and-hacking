# Problem Definition

Basically, you're given a string, and you want to split it into as few strings as possible such that each string is a palindrome.

## Example 1

`S = "ABCBD"`
This can be split into: `[A, BCB, D]`

Note that single letter strings are considered palindromes.

## Example 2

`S = ABCBADEDFG`
This can be split into: `[ABCBA, DED, F, G]`
